Project - Synthetic dataset generator for llm finetuning

1) Task- use any file(pdf, txt, ppt, docx, etc) and prepare a high quality synthetic instruction dataset using it to fine-tune llms.

2) Features:
	i) Should be able to generate is different formats like Alpaca etc.
	iii) Users should have option to choose the llm to generate the dataset.
	iv) It should have unit tests at each stage.
	v) Users can give the system prompt for Q/A generation.
	vi) The ui should display the dataset being generated during the runtime.
	vii) User should be able to monitor hardware usage like disk-read/write, gpu memory and usage, cpu, ram usage.
	viii) General statistics for the quality of data generated should be displayed.
	ix) 

3) Tech stack:
	i) ollama for generating the dataset.
	ii) react or whatever for the frontend.
	iii) fast api or something better for the backend.
	
4) Algorithm of running:
	i) User passes the file path, llm info for generation and dataset format.
	ii) Using ollama and a given llm, the program should generate Question/Answer pair and save it in a json file. Path to the output directory should be given.
